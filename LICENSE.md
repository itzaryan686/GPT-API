### Additional Considerations

- **Version Control**: Make sure to initialize a Git repository (`git init`) in your project directory and commit your changes regularly.
- **Updating License Year**: Update the 2024. placeholder in the LICENSE file each year to reflect the current year.
- **Customization**: Customize the `README.md` file with more detailed information about your project, such as installation steps, usage examples, and any other relevant details.

By including these files in your project, you ensure that users and contributors understand the licensing terms and have access to necessary project information. Adjust the content as per your project specifics and needs.
